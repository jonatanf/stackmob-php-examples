# About
This repository contains PHP code that can be used as an example for connecting your PHP app to StackMob. 
StackMob does not officially support a PHP SDK, but we are providing this code to anyone who wants to use it as a starting point for their PHP app.
If you find this code useful, please feel free to fork it and adapt it to your own needs. And if you'd like to contribute your changes back, please submit a pull request.

# Issues
We would like this code to be functional with the StackMob API, but as we currently don't officially support it, we may be unable to fix bugs quickly. If you encounter a bug, we encourage you to either file an issue [here](https://github.com/stackmob/stackmob-php-examples/issues) and/or fork this repository, fix the bug, and submit a pull request with the fix.

## Contributing
We encourage contributions to this code. If you'd like to contribute, fork this repository and make your changes. Before you submit a pull request to us with your changes, though, please make sure that you test it against live StackMob servers.
